This is a non-exhaustive list of ideas for future development.

- preparse config files to convert legacy root 'response' format to resources
- add openapi support (possibly as preparse step to convert openapi to resources)
- add support for pulling config from s3
- add support for pulling config from a remote git repo
- add support for pulling config from a remote http(s) server
- preparse config files to convert 'security' section to interceptors
- detect and hard fail if a config file specifies steps (script, remote)
- add entrypoint for running within imposter CLI
